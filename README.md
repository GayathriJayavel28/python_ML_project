Project Overview

Project Title-Predicting Student Placement Using Machine Learning

Objective:-
To develop a classification model that predicts whether a student will be placed based on their academic records and soft skills. The goal is to help educational institutions identify students needing additional support.

Dataset Description:-
The dataset includes profiles of 10,000 students and features such as:

-IQ Score

-CGPA

-Academic performance

-Number of Internships

-Communication Skills

-Other academic indicators

-The target column is Placement Status (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed).

Problem Statement:-
To build a predictive system that uses student profile data to classify them as likely to be placed or not, enabling targeted intervention.

Technologies Used:-

-Python

-Pandas & NumPy – Data handling and preprocessing

-Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization and EDA

-Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

-Correlation Matrix – Feature selection and insight discovery

Model Development, Correlation & Results

Steps Followed:-
1. Data Preprocessing Handled missing values

   Encoded categorical variables 

   Normalized numerical features like CGPA and IQ

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Used Matplotlib to create bar plots and pie charts showing placement distribution

   Created box plots to visualize how CGPA and number of internships relate to placement

   Discovered trends: Higher CGPA and internship experience positively impact placement likelihood

3. Feature Selection using Correlation

   Generated a correlation matrix to analyze relationships among features

   Used Seaborn heatmap to visualize correlations

   Identified CGPA, internships, and communication skills as highly correlated with placement

   Removed features with very low correlation to simplify the model

4. Model Building

   Trained classification algorithms:

   -Logistic Regression

   Evaluated using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

5. Confusion Matrix

   Evaluated predictions using a confusion matrix

Example output:

[[1651    0]
 [   0  348]]

   Accuracy Achieved: 99.9%

   Visualized using Seaborn’s heatmap() function for better interpretation

6. Visualization

   Matplotlib was used for detailed charts (bar, pie, histogram)

   Seaborn was used for heatmaps and pairplots

   Helped clearly present trends, relationships, and evaluation results

Conclusion:-
The project successfully demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting student placement outcomes. Using correlation and visualization techniques allowed us to identify key influencing factors and improve model accuracy. This solution can assist colleges in offering targeted career support and training for students at risk of not being placed.
